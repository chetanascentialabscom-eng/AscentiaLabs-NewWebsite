const HEALTHCARE_FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    question: "What is healthcare software development?",
    answer:
      "Healthcare software development is the process of designing, building, and deploying software solutions for healthcare organizations. It includes EHR software, EMR systems, hospital management software, medical billing software, and other healthcare IT solutions that streamline clinical and administrative operations.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between EHR and EMR software?",
    answer:
      "EMR software (Electronic Medical Record) is a digital version of a patient's paper chart within a single practice. EHR software (Electronic Health Record) is a more comprehensive record that can be shared across different healthcare providers and is designed to be interoperable across the healthcare system.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of hospital management software?",
    answer:
      "Hospital management software centralizes admissions, scheduling, billing, clinical documentation, and reporting. It improves operational efficiency, reduces errors, enhances patient experience, and provides real-time visibility into hospital performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does healthcare software cost?",
    answer:
      "Costs vary based on features, number of users, deployment model, and customizations. Cloud-based solutions typically use subscription pricing, while on-premise solutions involve license fees plus maintenance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there free EHR software available?",
    answer:
      "Some free EHR software options exist, but they typically offer limited features, lack scalability, and provide minimal support. Professional electronic health records software delivers significantly more value and long-term ROI.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is medical billing software?",
    answer:
      "Medical billing software automates the process of submitting and tracking claims to insurance companies, including claim creation, submission, denial management, payment posting, and reporting.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does AI improve healthcare software?",
    answer:
      "AI enhances healthcare software through clinical decision support, predictive analytics, medical image analysis, natural language processing, revenue cycle optimization, and workflow automation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is healthcare software secure?",
    answer:
      "Professional healthcare software includes role-based access control, data encryption, secure authentication, audit logs, automated backups, and HIPAA compliance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I integrate healthcare software with my existing systems?",
    answer:
      "Yes, modern healthcare software includes API integrations with EHR, EMR, billing, lab, pharmacy, and imaging systems, supported by HL7 and FHIR standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to implement healthcare software?",
    answer:
      "Implementation timeline varies based on complexity, customizations, and integrations, with typical implementations ranging from 4–12 weeks following a structured process.",
